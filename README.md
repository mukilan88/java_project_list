The project will need standard sockets and other networking in addition to the Java mail APIs. There are two main protocols used in the project – SMTP and POP3. This is one of the java projects for beginners. 
Usually, conventional email client software conducts electronic mailing through web browsers like Hotmail, Yahoo, Google, etc. Since these systems use HTTP port 80 to access all the emails, it is not precisely the best means to send sensitive or confidential messages. Hackers can easily hack into the software system and violate or misuse the data.
The project functions something like this – the ISP’s (Internet Service Provider) mail server handles the emails sent from an ISP. All the sent emails first come to the mail server, after which they are processed and forwarded to the collector’s destination where another mail server is located.
The mail server on the collector side receives the incoming emails and sorts them electronically in the inbox. Now, the recipient can use their email application to view the received emails. The entire transaction occurs by directly connecting to the mail server through the program, which makes it much safer than the existing email client software.
31. Library management system

This software project is implemented in Java using MS Access database design. It is designed for managing and maintaining libraries in any educational institution through an integrated computerized system. The library management software will allow librarians to operate more productively while handling the typical day-to-day tasks of a library. 
In a traditional library management system, everything is done manually. All the library operations and records, including the number of books, genres of books, names of books, records of the students who’ve issued/returned books, etc., are all done via pen and paper. Naturally, this process requires a significant amount of time, effort, and even human resources. If you are looking for final-year java projects, this is perfect for you.  
The proposed project seeks to solve all the challenges associated with the traditional library management system. Since it stores and manages all the library records in a computerized database, it eliminates the need for manual record-keeping. The software includes different modules, each of which handles and manages specific library operations. Mentioning Java projects can help your resume look much more interesting than others.
By using this software application, librarians and students need not search the entire library to find a book.

In this project, you will build a comprehensive online platform for managing both quiz competitions and the participants in the different teams. This application can be used by academic institutions and any organization willing to find suitable candidates through the process of quizzing. 
The application permits multiple admins, each having their unique user id and password. While admins can create an “n” number of participating teams for a quiz, they can also set an “n” number of rounds for the quiz. All the participants will automatically receive the questions, and the teams will have to answer within an allotted time.
In case a team is unable to answer a question or gives the wrong answer, they’ll receive a negative marking. The teams having the lowest average score will be eliminated, and the remaining teams will continue to compete in the next level. This will continue until the winner is declared. The scores for each team will be automatically updated. And this is the perfect idea for your next Java project!
33. RSS feed reader
The goal of the RSS feed reader project is to minimize the delay between the publication of new content on the web and its appearance on the reader/aggregator. It allows the retrieval of the latest content posted on a website quickly on the aggregator, thus, making the content readily accessible to the users for reading. The RSS feed reader management system is equipped with improved content monitoring policies for all RSS feeds. 
The existing aggregator management applications use the homogeneous Poisson model that relies on a specific data source (either a webpage or RSS feed). As a result, these applications cannot adapt if the data source changes. They do not even have well-designed monitoring policies. This project incorporates and implements new content monitoring strategies to overcome the drawbacks of the existing aggregator management applications. The new RSS feed reader leverages a non-homogeneous Poisson model and delays matrices.
This RSS feed reader management system investigates the techniques used by RSS aggregation services to monitor web content and to retrieve the data promptly using minimal resources, to enable readers to access the content without delay. The project focuses mainly on the server-based aggregation scenario.
The proposed model has the following functional requirements:
It should be able to provide information from disparate data sources to all users.
The system should be able to run efficiently using minimal system resources.
The time delay must be minimized so that users can view the data quickly on their feed.
The aggregated content should be converted into a document format compatible with browsers.
The RSS content must be monitored at frequent intervals.

40. Supply chain management system
This is one of the interesting Java projects. Supply chain management refers to the management of businesses interconnected over a network. It includes a whole range of management procedures like handling, storage, and movement of raw materials, inventory, and transporting finished goods from the source to its final destination.
This project aims to smoothen the supply chain management process by closely monitoring the dealers and clients and continually tracking the products through the different points in the supply chain. Using this application, a company can directly communicate with its clients, obtain the product requirements, manufacture the product to fit those requirements, and finally ship it off to the client. 
This project uses JSP, JDBC, and HTML for the front-end and MS Access as the back-end database. It is a web-based application that will automate the system of communication between the management or admin, dealers, and clients of the company. There are three modules in this application:
Admin module – The Admin uses this module to check information on the manufactured products, newly launched products, and products that must be delivered to the clients.
 Dealer module – This module keeps track of all the essential information concerning the dealers, particularly the record of items. Dealers can generate and update the item list for a product using this module. 
Client module – The client uses this module to provide the necessary specifications of a product. The client feedback is processed through this module and forwarded to the Admin. 
By using this application, the clients can directly convey their product requirements to the manufacturer, who then contacts multiple vendors to acquire the necessary resources for making the product. The dealers usually create a list of items as per the product information provided to them, after which the manufacturer selects the materials that best fit the specifications given by the client.
Then, the selected list of items is forwarded to the inventory department for processing, after which the manufacturing begins. Once the production is complete, the accounts department calculates the raw materials costs and manufacturing costs to generate the total bill. Finally, the product, along with the invoice, is shipped to the client. The client is free to offer feedback on the received product.
41. Virtual private network

VPN is one of the trending java projects. The goal of building this virtual private network (VPN) is to extend a private network across a public domain (for example, the Internet). A VPN is created by setting up a point-to-point virtual connection via traffic encryption, dedicated connections, or virtual tunneling protocols.

There are three interconnected modules in this VPN project: 
Administration module – This module monitors all the office operations and manages the staff details. 
Marketing module – This module handles everything related to the marketing operations of the software application.
Training module – This module manages all the technical operations like software testing, networking, call center, and J2EE training.
Confidentiality, authentication, and data integrity are the three core elements of this VPN security model. The other pivotal features of this application are:
It allows for the addition of new clients, a feature better known as “scalability.” This feature allows a company/organization to accommodate new clients in the network as it expands. 
It uses a remote backup server to prevent the system from failing due to sudden crashes. Since a VPN handles a large volume of files that are created every day, it is crucial to have a remote backup server to process all the requests coming from the client to the server and vice-versa.
It uses a remote monitoring system to keep track of the activities of every client or individual connected to the VPN. This ensures that the privacy and security of the network remain intact.
As is true of all VPNs, this VPN application, too, has the provision for certification in the system. When two or more LAN (Local Area Network) systems interact, certification is mandatory to protect the system’s security. 
It triggers and sends acknowledgment signals to notify clients of successful data transfer (whether or not the data has successfully reached the desired destination).

CRM systems operate by collecting customer data from various sources like the company’s website, live chats, social media, telephone, emails, etc.
This mini project in Java is an open-source desktop application consisting of 3 main roles — admin, user, and employee. The primary user is the admin, who can change product-related details like adding, deleting, and updating. They can also change the FAQs and keep track of user history, employee details, complaints, inquiries, etc. 
Employees can access complaints, inquiries, and product lists and also keep profiles updated with information collected from emails, calls, and chats. This reduces the time to resolve customer issues, enhancing the overall customer experience.
Conversely, users can view product details, raise complaints, view FAQs, and make service/product-related inquiries.
Some advantages of the CRM system are:
Build a robust and secure CRM application.
Drive customer engagement
Contains records of users, employees, complaints, resolutions, and more.
Provide error-free application
43. Mobile tracking system
Of all the Java project topics, this one ranks among the top useful application ideas. Mobile phones are no longer used for luxury but have become a necessity in the modern world. With violent incidents becoming commonplace, safety concerns have increased manifold in the last couple of years. This is where Java mini projects like this come in handy. 
As the name suggests, the mobile tracking system tracks the present location of a user’s phone. This web application is developed on MySQL database using PHP. It constantly updates the location of the chosen device every five seconds through a central tower. The system sends the server the mobile ID and location, along with the time the device was present at the location.
The system has to be installed in the chosen device, following which each device is assigned a unique ID. This ensures you can track the desired mobile phone from anywhere, anytime. This project aims to boost security and consists of two primary components: the web application (serves as the admin) and mobile tracking software installed on the phone to be tracked. 
Why Java?

Although Java is a relatively new programming language (it was launched in the early 1990s), it has created a unique niche in the IT industry. Java is the driving force behind some of the largest organizations, including Airbnb, Uber, eBay, Pinterest, Groupon, Spotify, Intel, Symantec, TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Flipkart, and TripAdvisor, to name a few.
As an OOP language, Java has a modular structure, making solving complex problems significantly easier. Thus, programmers can write reusable codes with Java, enhancing the development process. Additionally, Java offers various features, such as polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation, that further simplify the code-writing process. Easy to program and run, Java-based applications can be developed to operate on one computer as well as multiple client and server systems within a network.
The five main reasons for Java’s popularity are:
Platform independence – Java runs on the WORA (Writing Once, Run Anywhere). A Java code is compiled into an intermediate format (a.k.a. bytecode), which is then executed in the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). So, any system running a JVM can execute Java code. Furthermore, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is compatible with all three operating systems – Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Multi-threaded – Java has inbuilt multithreading capabilities, which means that you can develop highly interactive and responsive apps with multiple concurrent threads of activity using Java.
Object-oriented – Java is a purely object-oriented language. Inspired by C and C++, Java extends the functionality of these languages to become a pure object-oriented programming language. Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are some of its core OOP features. 
Secure – When it comes to safety, Java incorporates a host of safety features into the runtime systems, including runtime checking and static type-checking at the time of compilation. With these features in place, it is pretty challenging to hack into a Java application from an external source.
Robust – Java leverages a simple memory management model reinforced by automatic garbage collection. Since Java objects do not require external references, Java code is robust. Besides, it also encourages developers to adopt productive programming habits for developing secure and reliable applications. The more you experiment with different java projects, the more knowledge you gain.
Open source – Java’s position as the second most trending programming language worldwide (IEEE Spectrum) in 2023 primarily rests on it being freely available for use; in other words, it is open source. This makes it ideal for developers and programmers of various competencies looking to build apps of their own. They can even access the latest versions of Oracle JDK and Open JDK free of charge through the Java Development Kit.
API rich – Consisting of approximately 52 keywords, Java boasts a rich and extensive API (Application Programming Interface). Thus, making projects in Java is easy, with a multitude of methods available for use in any program directly. Developers can accomplish any task with Java API methods, whether handling output input, networking, processing XML, or connecting to databases.
Community backup – Java’s robust and active community is among the many reasons for its continuing popularity. The Java Community, Stack Overflow, and Java in General are some of the top communities where developers and beginners alike can find assistance when faced with a problem. If you are developing core Java projects or seeking project ideas for Java, you can find extensive and reliable support on these websites from expert developers.
Documentation support – Another factor contributing to Java’s immense popularity is its detailed documentation feature. Javadoc, a well-documented guide, provides solutions to developers who face problems while coding any application or program.
Development tools – In addition to frameworks, integrated development environments (IDE), and profilers, Java has an arsenal of various automation, debugging, and editing tools. Java has tools for every type of development project along with various stages of development. Different projects in Java require the use of different tools. These include Maven for building applications, Jenkins for integration and delivery, JIRA for bug tracking and planning, and Splunk for monitoring, to name a few.
User-friendly – Java offers an easy learning curve with its simple English syntax and use of minimum special characters. This makes it easy for beginners and professionals to master this language. Basic knowledge of programming languages like C and C++ is all that is needed to learn Java and build projects using Java later. Resources are readily available online on various websites, mostly for free.
